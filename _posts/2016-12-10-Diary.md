The time past so quick.
I want to write something about myself, about whatever, I need to write down something to record worthy things, and , I need to talk to myself. After all, I didn’t talk with anybody with any word, except for “Thank you"

So, at first, what I did today.
I updated the code to download the articles from weixin, and now, it can download from multiple sources along with the text and pic.
and I enlarge the type of articles published on my website. I added some jokes to it. Maybe it will attract more people to it.

Afternoon, I did nothing, I just don’t want to do anything, I don’t want to study, I have no interests in it, and I think I cannot get a high score from it.

The great thing is , I swam again, after about a week no exercise, and now I feel good, not tired too much.

I know I need to increase the efficient, maybe tomorrow greater.
