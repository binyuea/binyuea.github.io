Leader, Established Yi-Ben Three Dimensions Tech Co.,Ltd


Provided technologies to ordinary photo studio, obtained data to establish models, printed and painted, and then delivered to customers.  
- Used capture dimension technology to capture images, established 3D models.  
- Made 3D printer based on RepRap with the accuracy of 0.3mm.  
- Designed a support for photo studio, enabled the image capture be finished in 40s with 3 cameras.

<p>You know, there are some 3D photo studios around us. They can help people to form themselves in small models. This is a good catch, especially in wedding. If you have the other half and yourself in wedding dresses, shown up above the wedding cake in about 10 inch, that would be a supprise to everyone and an amazing memory for yours.</p>
<br>
<p>
We provide the same service, but in a better way.  
<br>  
In a more efficient way.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
Traditional 3D photo studios use machines to print colors for models.  
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/3d_photo/1.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>
<br>
But we don't,  <br>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/3d_photo/2.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>
We only print the colourless model. And find the optimal printers to do the face-printing thing.  
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/3d_photo/3.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>
</p>
<br>


Traditional 3D photo studios use handheld device to detect data of people. This always takes about 3 minutes or more. During this time, customer need to keep his/her poristion. <br>
And it is a bad user experience.
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/3d_photo/4.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>
However, We use capture dimension technology, use 3 camers to capture about 60 pictures, only need to wait for it to turn around the customer. It only takes 20s. 
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/3d_photo/5.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>
So, it brings a good user experience.
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/3d_photo/6.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>
And it can catch the moment which requests strictly in low delay.
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/3d_photo/7.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>


<p>
Finally, <br>
Traditional 3D photo studios allocate all machines and all workers in a place, which cost a lot.
<br><br>
But we don't, <br>
We cooprate with local wedding photography, provide 3D photo service for customers with them, using their cameras to get the data, and then build and print the model of customer. After printer done their face-making job, we will send the model to its customer. In this way, we don't need to book a new place, and we can use the resources of wedding photography. 
</p>

So, you see, it can save a lot for us : )
