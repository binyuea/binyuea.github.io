This is an Android APP published on Google Play.  
You can search for it by the keyword "TimeGo".  

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.timego.harbin.timego&hl=en">Or you can click here : )</a>

I built this APP is because there isn't a right APP to solve my problem.

## Why is this a bad design?
This is one of the most common APPs about time tracking in google play.
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/timego/atimelogger.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>

You clicked an icon, the timer starts recording. When you finished your activity, you clicked the stop button. Then this activity and its duration has been recorded.  
But there is a common problem: I always forget to start or end an activity recording, so the time tracking is not precise, and therefore it is annoying.

## How to solve this problem?
Raised an idea from "time billing" of Alexander Alexandrovich Lyubishchev.  

The key is to record the time cost of each activity after the things done or at a certain moment. In this way, the time tracking is easier and more precise.

## What is it look like?  
- The adding fragment screen is like:  

<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/timego/add.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>
<br>
And I provided the emotion options for users, which can be defined as an efficiency options. Because I think 100% efficiency in 30 minutes is still much better than 10% efficiency in 3 hours.  
So, these options can help users to find out during which time slot they can get a better performance.  

- The dash board: 

<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/timego/dash.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>
This is a pie chart. Day, week and month options are provided.
<br>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/timego/dashline.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>
This is a line chart. Users can see how the time costing trends they spent in the last week.

- Intro to App  
To let it used easier for users, provide intro-to-APP part. It shows when the user open TimeGo in the first time, Or when users click "help" button.


<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/timego/intro.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>


- Feedback  
Provide feedback choice for users, and users can talk their ideas with me. I think this communication way is better for us to talk with each other, to have a deeper understanding about what this product shoule be.  

<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/timego/feedback.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>


- The Accounts  
TimeGo provided online database based on the Google firebase to sync data from different platform.  
So, we have Sign in option:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/timego/signin.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>
And Sign up option:
<div style="text-align:center"><img src= "{{ "/img/projects/timego/signup.png " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"></div>
<br>


## Summary  
I love this APP, I always think of ways to improve it.  
And I'm still working on it.  
Hope it may help your life well. : )
