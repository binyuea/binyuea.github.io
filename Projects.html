<h3>EECS482(Operating System)</h3>
<ul align="left">
<li>Threads: Designed a concurrent Thread Library for multi-processor multi-thread applications. CPUs go sleep or wake up depending on current thread’s request. Error handling such as resource exhaustion is considered.</li>
<li>Memory Manager: Implemented a pager that manages application processes’ virtual address spaces, including swap block and file block. Zero-pin page, Copy-on-write and some performance optimization are included.</li>
<li>File Server: Achieved a multi-threaded, secure network file server. Client processes will interact with it via network messages to access and modify their data. Access without permission will be abandoned.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Web Service : EECS485(Web dbase)</h3>
Building a web server which users can visit public and personal albums, and upload new photos to these albums. 'Sign in' and 'Sign up' options are provided.
<ul align="left">
<li>Using Flask to build a web server, and html with Jinja2 to build web pages. Using JavaScript to build client-side application, and AJAX and JSON to transfer data between server and client browser.   </li>
<li>Using session to keep users state, and SHA512 with salt to defend rainbow attack. Authorizing user permission to access sensitive pages depends on their sessions.</li>
</ul>





<h3 >Database : EECS484(Datebase)</h3>
Building a Relational database for storing information about ”Fakebook” social network with constraints for them.
<ul align="left">
<li>Using JDBC to implement Fakebook Oracle, a program that answers several queries about the Fakebook database.</li>
<li>Implementing a single-threaded version of ARIES to recover from crash.</li>
<li>Exporting data from Oracle to MongoDB, and writing MongoDB queries to operate it.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>MapReduce Engine : EECS485(Web dbase)</h3>
<ul align="left">
<li>Implementing a Hadoop-like MapReduce facility, with master and worker nodes for map-reduce operations over large datasets, with a distributed file system, and fault tolerance to address datanode failures.
</li>
</ul>



<h3>2-way R10K : 2-way superscalar out-of-order processor</h3>
In this project, I'm in charge of RS, CDB, Fetch, I/D cache and Branch Predictor.
<ul align="left">
<li>Data cache: Used 2-way set associate cache and LRU(refer, dirty bit) to determine which block will be evicted to memory saves the usage of memory’s I/O.</li>
<li>Instruction cache: Directed map cache, easy to implement, is good enough for instruction requirements.</li>
<li>Prefetch: Adopted this priority (Dcache load, Icache load, Icache prefetch, Dcache store) to prefetch when the memory I/O are limited to accelerate system speed.</li>
<li>RS(reserve station): Allocated different blocks to corresponding instructions. In this way, we can issue at most 6 instructions(2 ALU, 1 STORE, 1 LOAD, 1 MULT, 1 BRANCH), which can improve system potential performance.</li>
</ul>
