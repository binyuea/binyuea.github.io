<h3>2-way R10K : An out of order true renaming register processor</h3>
In this project, I'm in charge of RS, I/D cache, fetch, prefetch, predictor, CDB.
<ul align="left">
<li>Dcache: Using 2-way set associate cache and LRU(refer, dirty bit) algorithm to determine which block will be evicted to memory can decrease the usage for I/O of memory.</li>
<li>Icache: Directed map cache, easy to implement, and it fits to instruction fetch features.</li>
<li>Prefetch: For higher usage I/O of memory, prefetch allocate I/O accroding to this priority order(from high to low): Dcache load, Icache load, Icache prefetch, Dcache store.</li>
<li>RS(reserve station): Recording each instruction state, and determine which instruction to issue. I allocated different blocks to corresponding insn. In this way, we can issue at most 6 instructions(2 alu, 1 store, 1 load, 1 mult, 1 branch), which can improve system potential performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pipeline : EECS470(Computer architecture)</h3>
Providing implementation of VeriSimple4 to handle hazards and forwarding. In this way, the CPI can be decreased from 5 to 2.



<h3>Threads and Concurrency : EECS482(Operating System)</h3>
<ul align="left">
<li>Project 1: A simple concurrent program that schedules disk requests, based on multi-threaded programs using monitors.
</li>
 <li>Project 2: Implement a thread library: Threads and monitors are implemented on uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems.</li>
<li>Project 3: Pager for memory manager: A part of kernel that manages application processes' virtual address spaces, including swap block(private) and file block(public).</li>
<li>Project 4: Network file system: A multi-threaded, secure network file server. Clients that use file server will interact with it via sockets.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Web Service : EECS485(Web dbase)</h3>
Building a web server which users can visit public and personal albums, and upload new photos to these albums. 'Sign in' and 'Sign up' options are provided.
<ul align="left">
<li>Using Flask to build a web server, and html with Jinja2 to build web pages. Using JavaScript to build client-side application, and AJAX and JSON to transfer data between server and client browser.   </li>
<li>Using session to keep users state, and SHA512 with salt to defend rainbow attack. Authorizing user permission to access sensitive pages depends on their sessions.</li>
</ul>





<h3 >Database : EECS484(Datebase)</h3>
Building a Relational database for storing information about ”Fakebook” social network with constraints for them.
<ul align="left">
<li>Using JDBC to implement Fakebook Oracle, a program that answers several queries about the Fakebook database.</li>
<li>Implementing a single-threaded version of ARIES to recover from crash.</li>
<li>Exporting data from Oracle to MongoDB, and writing MongoDB queries to operate it.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>MapReduce Engine : EECS485(Web dbase)</h3>
<ul align="left">
<li>Implementing a Hadoop-like MapReduce facility, with master and worker nodes for map-reduce operations over large datasets, with a distributed file system, and fault tolerance to address datanode failures.
</li>
</ul>
